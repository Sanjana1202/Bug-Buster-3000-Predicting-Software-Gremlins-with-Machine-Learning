# Software-Fault-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-1
A software fault prediction model developed using machine learning algorithms. This project was contributed as a minor project during undergraduation.
This model is developed using  algorithms like random forest and support vector that predicts faults of a software to improve testing 
duration, Resources, infrastructure costs and project risks.
